They are young (by naiad standards), pretty wild and eager to bring any human stuff into their settlement. <br/> It is generally accepted that their love of wandering is due to their species, however, there is growing evidence that it is some kind of initiation ritual for them, the success of which depends on the rarity of what they find. This means that they value humans themselves (not always living ones) more than anything else."

				"text": "Naiads can be found not only in their ancestral settlements and the waters of the Pandemonium. Some of them inhabit coastal astral cities (they live mostly on beaches and in the shrines of water gods). <br/> They try to stay close to the dealers of curiosities, though most of them are penniless and do not seek to earn money. For them, the surest way to get what they want is to seduce unsuspecting travelers. If the chosen victim resists, they use their sharp teeth. "

				"text": "The more experienced naiads become, the more they become immersed in human mass culture. <br/> Many of them, for example, are no longer surprised by the existence of movies or anime, though their astral video projections are still quite rare. <br/> Because of this, naiads most often collect only fan merch or make clothing that replicates the most famous images. <br/> It is believed that whoever helps a naiad with 'cosplay' can get rich, because the dyes for the fabric of the demoness are extracted from deep-sea coral. The price of such on the black market is exorbitant!"

They appropriate sunken human ships and things that have entered the Pandemonium through the astral stream. Some of them are so clever that they create settlements based on the political ideologies of the inhabitants of Earth. <br/> Travelers often say that not far away from the ice wastelands of Eigu you can meet communist neiads. They prefer the pioneer uniforms to any other clothing and speak fluent Russian. In an effort to create equality, they share everything with their sisters, including potential partners."

				"text": "Among the inhabitants of Pandemonium, it is commonly believed that naiads and serious relationships are incompatible, but marrying a human is not only an incredible good fortune for them, but also a desirable goal. <br/> Naiads don’t have documents, so “marriage” looks like a series of magic rituals. Only one of them is known for certain: the night of the union, the naiads exchange bites with the chosen one. <br/> The fate of the people who once married the demonesses could not be ascertained (probably because of special secrecy)."
